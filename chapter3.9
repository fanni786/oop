(Using a Class Without a using Directive) Explain how a program could use class string
without inserting a using directive.?

If you mean you want to use std::string without using namespace std;statement, you simply qualify the names 
from std namespace; i.e. write std::string.

BTW, don’t use using namespace std; statement. IMO it’s a bad idea, particularly in header files. 
“Importing” all the names from the standard namespace may (and will) very likely lead to a lot of name clashes. 
That’s why the std namespace identifier is so short; so that it doesn’t bother you that you qualify your names.
Example:
std namespace identifier
