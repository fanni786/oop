(Data Members) Explain the purpose of a data member?

A class provides a data member (or several data members) when each object of the class must maintain data separately 
from all other objects of the class. For example,a class called Account that represents a bank account provides a data 
member to represent the balance of the account.
Each Account object maintains its own balance, but does not know the balances of the bankâ€™s other accounts.
