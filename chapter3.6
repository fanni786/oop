(Q3.6) :(Default Constructor) What’s a default constructor? How are an object’s data members initialized if a class has only an implicitly defined default constructor

A default constructor is the constructor that is called when a programmer creates an object without specifying any arguments to 
a constructor.
The programmer can write a default constructor that initializes data members any way the programmer chooses. 
The compiler provides a default constructor with no parameters in any class that does not explicitly include a constructor.
The default constructor provided by the compiler creates an object without assigninganyinitial values to the object’s data members—data
members must be initialized using the object’s member functions. Every constructor implicitly calls the constructors of any 
data member objects before the body of the class’s constructor executes.
